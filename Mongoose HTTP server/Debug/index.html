    <strong>Pink Floyd</strong> were an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining a following as a
    psychedelic rock group, they were distinguished for their extended compositions, sonic
    experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows, and became a leading band
    of the progressive rock genre. They are one of the most commercially successful and influential
    bands in popular music history.<br><br>
    Pink Floyd were founded by students Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), 
    Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals), and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals).
    Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to
    deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the
    concepts behind the albums <i>"The Dark Side of the Moon"</i> (1973), <i>"Wish You Were Here"</i> (1975), 
    <i>"Animals"</i> (1977), <i>"The Wall"</i> (1979), & <i>"The Final Cut"</i> (1983). The band also composed several film scores.<br><br>
    Following personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour & Mason
    continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. The three produced two more albums — <i>"A Momentary Lapse
    of Reason"</i> (1987), <i>"The Division Bell"</i> (1994), & toured both albums before entering a long period of
    inactivity. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a one-off performance at the global awareness event
    Live 8. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, <i>"The Endless River"</i>
    (2014), was based on unreleased material from the Division Bell recording sessions.<br><br>
    Pink Floyd were one of the first British psychedelia groups, and are credited with influencing genres
    such as progressive rock and ambient music. Four albums topped US or UK record charts, the songs <i>"See
    Emily Play"</i> (1967) and <i>"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2"</i> (1979) were their only top 10 singles in
    either territory. The band were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music
    Hall of Fame in 2005. By 2013, they had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, with The Dark Side
    of the Moon and The Wall two of the best-selling albums of all time.<br><br>
